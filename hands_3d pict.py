"""ML pipeline, proven to be effective in our MediaPipe Hands and MediaPipe Face Mesh solutions. Using a detector, the pipeline first locates the person/pose region-of-interest (ROI) within the frame. The tracker subsequently predicts the pose landmarks and segmentation mask within the ROI using the ROI-cropped frame as input. Note that for video use cases the detector is invoked only as needed, i.e., for the very first frame and when the tracker could no longer identify body pose presence in the previous frame. For other frames the pipeline simply derives the ROI from the previous frameâ€™s pose landmarks."""
